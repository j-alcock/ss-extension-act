Dear [Member],

I am writing about a matter that directly affects [XX,000] of your
constituents who receive Social Security benefits.

The Social Security trust fund is projected to be depleted by 2034.
When that happens — and the trustees confirm it will happen without
legislative action — benefits will be automatically reduced by 23%.
For your constituents receiving the average benefit of $1,907 per
month, that is a cut of $439 per month. No vote required. It happens
by operation of law.

I am not writing to propose new government spending. I am writing to
propose a market-based solution that protects your constituents'
earned benefits and generates returns through the same financial
markets that have built American prosperity.

THE SOCIAL SECURITY CRISIS IN YOUR DISTRICT

  - Approximately [XX,000] of your constituents receive Social
    Security (retired workers, disabled workers, survivors, dependents)
  - Average monthly benefit: $1,907
  - Projected cut at 2034 depletion: -$439/month per recipient
  - Annual loss per constituent: -$5,268
  - This cut requires no legislative action — it is the default

Every year of inaction brings this closer. The political consequences
of a 23% Social Security cut are well understood.

A MARKET-BASED SOLUTION

This proposal has one core innovation: it uses market returns —
equity market returns — to fund Social Security obligations, rather
than relying solely on a shrinking worker-to-beneficiary ratio.

THE ALASKA MODEL

Alaska's Permanent Fund has done exactly this since 1982. It invests
resource revenues in a diversified portfolio and pays dividends to
every Alaska resident. It has operated for over 40 years under both
Republican and Democratic governors. It is wildly popular. No
politician who has tried to reduce the Permanent Fund Dividend has
survived politically. This is the model.

THE NORWAY MODEL

Norway's Government Pension Fund Global — $1.7 trillion in assets —
invests oil revenues in global equities and fixed income, earning
5.7% real returns since 1998. It is independently managed, with
investment policy set by statute, not politicians. It represents the
gold standard of sovereign fund governance. This is the governance
framework.

HOW IT WORKS

1. Close a payroll tax loophole. Currently, someone earning $10 million
   per year pays the same dollar amount in Social Security tax as
   someone earning $168,600. Income above the cap is exempt. Medicare
   eliminated its cap in 1994. This proposal does the same for Social
   Security. This single change generates enough revenue to solve the
   solvency crisis permanently.

2. Invest the surplus. Revenue beyond what's needed for current
   benefits flows into an American Equity Fund — invested in the
   same markets that generate returns for pension funds, endowments,
   and every 401(k) in America. The fund is managed independently,
   with no Congressional draw rights.

3. Pay dividends to Americans. The fund generates returns. Those
   returns fund additional monthly payments to Social Security
   recipients and to working Americans who earn below a self-
   sufficiency threshold.

This is a MARKET SOLUTION. It does not create a new welfare program.
It creates a sovereign investment fund that earns returns and
distributes them through the existing Social Security infrastructure.

WHAT ABOUT THE BILLIONAIRE TAX?

Separately, the proposal includes a provision to tax the investment
income of individuals with over $1 billion in net worth — income that
currently goes untaxed because it consists of unrealized gains.

This is not a wealth tax. It is an income tax — applied to real
economic income that billionaires currently shelter through the buy-
borrow-die strategy. When their stock goes up $10 billion, that is
income. They should pay tax on it, just as your constituents pay tax
on their income.

However — this provision is OPTIONAL. The system works without it.
FICA reform alone funds the entire system. The billionaire provision
accelerates the fund build-out but is not required.

THE ALTERNATIVE

The alternative to this proposal is not "nothing." The alternative is
a 23% Social Security benefit cut in 2034 — affecting your
constituents, your retirees, your disabled veterans, your widows and
widowers.

The politics of that outcome are straightforward: the party that
allows it to happen will be held responsible by 67 million voters.

WHAT I AM ASKING

I am not asking you to co-sponsor a bill. I am asking you to:

  1. Review the attached 2-page brief on the market-based component
  2. Allow a 20-minute staff briefing on the fiscal mechanics
  3. Consider whether a market-based approach to SS solvency deserves
     a hearing alongside other reform options

This is a conversation about protecting your constituents' earned
benefits using market returns. That is not a partisan position. It
is a fiscal one.
