      <Subject>Expanding Social Security: Revenue-Constrained Benefit Extension</Subject>
      <LibraryOfCongressTopic>Social Security</LibraryOfCongressTopic>
      <Body><![CDATA[Dear Representative Joyce Beatty,

I am writing to bring to your attention a comprehensive, revenue-constrained proposal to expand Social Security benefits to all American adults living below the living wage threshold — without adding a single dollar to the federal deficit.

THE PROPOSAL: The Social Security Extension Act would:

1. RESTRUCTURE FICA to fund a new Tier 2 benefit for 138 million eligible adults (67M current SS beneficiaries + 71M working-age adults below $2,200/month living wage)

2. IMPLEMENT mark-to-market taxation on economic income exceeding $1 billion in wealth, generating $210 billion in Year 1, growing to $578 billion by Year 10

3. ESTABLISH a sovereign equity fund (modeled on Alaska's Permanent Fund and Norway's Government Pension Fund) to provide stable, growing returns

KEY NUMBERS FROM OUR MODEL:
- Year 1 benefits: $198-249/month per eligible adult
- Year 30 benefits: $798-1,731/month (depending on wealth tax inclusion)
- Income Gini reduction: 0.39 to 0.32 (18% — moves US to Canada's level)
- GDP impact: +5.3% by Year 30 via consumption multiplier effects
- Billionaire impact: Wealth still grows from $8.8B average to $110B over 40 years (vs $157B without tax)
- Social Security solvency: Guaranteed by revenue-constrained design — benefits adjust automatically to available revenue

This proposal has been modeled with five behavioral response regimes, stress-tested under adverse conditions, and analyzed for general equilibrium effects. Full documentation including a working paper, policy brief, and technical appendix are available.

I respectfully request the opportunity to provide a staff briefing on this proposal, and ask that you consider co-sponsoring enabling legislation.

Respectfully,
 
,
