  THE SOCIAL SECURITY EXTENSION ACT
  Legislative Concept Brief
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Social Security Extension Act (SSEA) addresses two converging
fiscal challenges: (1) the projected insolvency of the OASDI trust
fund by 2034, and (2) the growing gap between labor income and the
cost of living for over one-third of working-age adults.

The SSEA creates a fully funded second tier of Social Security
benefits for Americans who need them, financed through payroll tax
reform on high earners and a mark-to-market income tax on billionaire
investment gains. It requires no deficit spending and is revenue-
constrained by construction: benefits equal only what the system
collects.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  THE PROBLEM
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1. Social Security Insolvency

   The OASDI trust fund is projected to be depleted by 2034.[1] Upon
   depletion, benefits will be automatically reduced to approximately
   77% of scheduled levels — a 23% cut affecting 67 million
   beneficiaries. The current annual deficit is approximately $200
   billion and growing.

2. Income Inadequacy

   37% of working-age adults (18-66) earn below the MIT Living Wage
   Calculator's national average of $2,200 per month for a single
   adult.[2] This represents approximately 71 million people who work
   but cannot afford basic living expenses.

3. Tax Base Erosion at the Top

   935 U.S. billionaires hold $8.2 trillion in combined wealth.[3]
   Through the buy-borrow-die strategy — borrowing against unrealized
   gains rather than selling assets — their effective tax rate on
   wealth growth averages approximately 3.4%, lower than the effective
   rate paid by median-income workers.[4]

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  THE PROPOSAL: THREE COMPONENTS
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

COMPONENT 1: FICA REFORM ($728B/year in new revenue)

  a. Remove the FICA earnings cap (currently $168,600). All earned
     income contributes to Social Security proportionally.

  b. Extend FICA to investment income (capital gains, dividends,
     carried interest) at half the standard rate.

  c. Employer-side adjustment to prevent competitiveness drag.

  Revenue allocation:
    - First priority: Cover the existing SS deficit (~$200B/year)
    - Remainder: Fund the Tier 2 benefit and equity fund

COMPONENT 2: TIER 2 BENEFIT (Revenue-Constrained)

  Eligible recipients:
    - All current SS beneficiaries (67M) — always eligible
    - Working-age adults earning below $2,200/month (~71M)
    - Total eligible: ~138 million adults (53% of adult population)

  Benefit structure:
    - Monthly payment = (available revenue) / (eligible population) / 12
    - Benefits can never decrease nominally (benefit ratchet)[5]
    - The Tier 2 benefit does NOT count as income for eligibility
      purposes, avoiding the classic poverty trap

  Projected benefit levels (moderate scenario):
  ┌──────────┬────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┐
  │ Year     │ Monthly    │ Retiree Total (SS + Tier 2)      │
  ├──────────┼────────────┼──────────────────────────────────┤
  │  0       │   $249     │  $2,156                          │

  │ 20       │   $762     │  $3,596                          │
  │ 30       │ $1,731     │  $5,185                          │
  └──────────┴────────────┴──────────────────────────────────┘

COMPONENT 3: BILLIONAIRE INCOME TAX ($210B/year, accelerant)

  Structure:
    - 40% tax on economic income (including unrealized gains via
      mark-to-market) for individuals with >$1B in net worth
    - Follows the Wyden Billionaires Income Tax framework[6]
    - Constitutional viability: Moore v. United States (2024) did not
      prohibit mark-to-market taxation[7]

  Revenue allocation:
    - 60% to the American Equity Fund (sovereign wealth fund)
    - 40% directly to Tier 2 benefits

  Behavioral response (realistic central estimate):
    - Expected avoidance: ~7% base, ceiling at 30%
    - Net collection rate: ~81% of statutory revenue
    - Emigration: negligible (exit tax = 23.8% of all unrealized gains)

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  KEY RISKS AND MITIGATIONS
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  RISK: Constitutional challenge to mark-to-market taxation
  MITIGATION: Moore v. US (2024) left M2M taxation intact; Congress
  can also implement as a minimum tax on realized income with
  lookback, avoiding the constitutional question entirely.

  RISK: Billionaire avoidance exceeds projections
  MITIGATION: Model is revenue-constrained — if avoidance is higher,
  benefits are lower, not deficits higher. The FICA reform alone
  (without the billionaire tax) still funds the system.

  RISK: Labor supply reduction
  MITIGATION: At projected benefit levels ($250-$1,700/month),
  employment effects are modest (1-4% reduction). GDP effect is net
  positive due to consumption multiplier and inequality reduction.[8]

  RISK: Equity market impact
  MITIGATION: Sovereign fund buying supports, not depresses, equity
  prices (Gabaix-Koijen inelastic markets hypothesis). Fund is a
  permanent holder, providing market stability.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  THE ASK
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  1. Request CBO scoring of the three-component framework
  2. Committee hearing on Social Security solvency options
  3. Bipartisan working group on sovereign equity fund governance
  4. Joint Finance/Ways and Means review of M2M tax structure
