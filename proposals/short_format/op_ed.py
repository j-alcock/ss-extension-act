SOCIAL SECURITY WAS BUILT TO GROW. IT'S TIME.

When Franklin Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act in 1935, it
covered only retired workers in commerce and industry — roughly half the
labor force. No survivors benefits. No disability. No Medicare. The
first monthly check was $22.54.

Over the next nine decades, we expanded it. Survivors benefits in 1939.
Disability in 1956. Medicare in 1965. Cost-of-living adjustments in
1972. Each expansion was called radical at the time. Each became
untouchable.

Now Social Security faces two crises at once — and they point to the
same solution.

THE FIRST CRISIS: INSOLVENCY

The Social Security trust fund will be depleted by 2034, according to
the program's own trustees. When that happens, 67 million Americans —
retirees, disabled workers, survivors — face an automatic 23% benefit
cut. For a retiree receiving the average $1,907 per month, that's $439
less. Every month. With no vote required.

This is not a projection from partisans. It is the trustees' central
estimate, published annually and accepted by CBO, Treasury, and both
parties.

THE SECOND CRISIS: THE WORKING POOR

Thirty-seven percent of working-age Americans earn less than $2,200 per
month — the MIT Living Wage Calculator's national average for a single
adult. These are not the unemployed. They are home health aides, retail
workers, warehouse staff, gig drivers, childcare providers. They work.
They just cannot afford to live on what they earn.

Meanwhile, 935 American billionaires hold $8.2 trillion in wealth and,
according to ProPublica's analysis of IRS data, pay a lower effective
tax rate on their wealth gains than a schoolteacher pays on her salary.
The mechanism is simple: they borrow against their stock instead of
selling it, never triggering a taxable event. Buy, borrow, die. Their
heirs inherit at a stepped-up basis, and the gains are never taxed.

THE SOLUTION: SOCIAL SECURITY EXTENSION

The proposal has three parts:

First, save Social Security. Reform FICA by removing the earnings cap
that currently exempts income above $168,600 and extending payroll
contributions to investment income. This alone generates over $700
billion per year in new revenue — more than enough to cover the
projected deficit.

Second, extend a new "Tier 2" monthly benefit to adults who need it:
all current Social Security beneficiaries, plus working-age adults
earning below the living wage. That is approximately 138 million people
— not everyone, but more than half of American adults. The benefit
starts at roughly $250 per month, funded entirely from the new revenue
stream. No deficit spending.

Third, build an American Equity Fund — a sovereign wealth fund modeled
on Norway's $1.7 trillion Government Pension Fund and Alaska's
Permanent Fund, which has paid every Alaskan resident an annual dividend
for over 40 years, under both Republican and Democratic governors. The
fund compounds. Benefits grow. Within 30 years, the Tier 2 benefit
reaches approximately $1,700 per month.

To accelerate this, apply a 40% tax on the economic income of
billionaires — including the unrealized gains they currently shelter.
This follows the framework proposed by Senate Finance Chair Ron Wyden
and economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. It generates roughly
$210 billion per year initially, rising as wealth grows.

THE HONEST TRADEOFF

Here is what the numbers show: After 30 years of this system, the
average American billionaire's wealth grows from $8.8 billion to over
$100 billion. Without the tax, it would have reached $157 billion. They
are still billionaires. They still compound. They simply grow their
wealth six-fold instead of eighteen-fold.

On the other side: 138 million Americans receive a meaningful income
floor. Retirees see their combined Social Security benefit exceed
$5,000 per month. Workers earning $1,500 a month cross the living wage
threshold. U.S. income inequality drops by 18%, from the worst in the
developed world to roughly the level of Canada.

GDP grows. Consumer spending by low-income recipients — who spend 90
cents of every dollar they receive — generates a fiscal multiplier that
more than offsets the modest reduction in labor supply.

This is not radical. It is what Social Security has always done: expand
the floor, broaden the base, protect the vulnerable. The question is
not whether we can afford to do it. With a trust fund headed for
insolvency and billionaires paying lower effective rates than their
employees, the question is whether we can afford not to.
