SUBJECT: Protecting Social Security for 67 Million Retirees — Market-Based Approach
TOPIC: Social Security
============================================================

Dear Representative Gus Bilirakis,

Social Security faces a solvency crisis that will directly impact your constituents. By 2034, the trust fund will be depleted and 67 million Americans — including retirees, disabled veterans, and survivors — face an automatic 23% benefit cut. This affects every state and every district.

I am writing to share a market-based approach to protecting these benefits:

THE APPROACH:
- Modernize Social Security's revenue structure using market-based returns, similar to the Alaska Permanent Fund (which has paid dividends to every Alaskan since 1982) and Norway's Government Pension Fund ($1.7 trillion)
- Revenue-constrained design: benefits can NEVER exceed available revenue — no deficit spending, no unfunded mandates
- Solvency guaranteed by mathematical construction, not political promises

BY THE NUMBERS:
- 67 million Americans currently depend on Social Security
- 2034: projected trust fund depletion year
- 23%: automatic benefit cut at depletion
- $28.0 trillion: current US GDP
- The proposed revenue structure delivers $106/month in additional benefits from Year 1, growing with market returns

This is not an expansion of government. It is a restructuring of existing revenue flows to protect benefits your constituents have earned and depend on. The design prevents any spending beyond what revenue supports.

A brief (4-page) analysis is available for your review. I respectfully request 20 minutes with your staff to discuss how this framework protects FL constituents.

Respectfully,
 
,
