Dear [Member],

I am writing to bring to your attention a comprehensive proposal to
expand Social Security into a universal income security system for the
21st century — the Social Security Extension Act.

You have been a champion of working families, and this proposal is
built on the foundation you have fought to protect. Social Security is
America's most successful anti-poverty program. This plan extends that
success to the 138 million American adults who currently earn below
a living wage.

THE URGENCY

Social Security faces insolvency by 2034. Without action, 67 million
Americans — disproportionately communities of color, women, and
disabled workers — face a 23% benefit cut. At the same time, 37% of
working-age adults earn less than what MIT calculates is needed for
basic self-sufficiency ($2,200/month). These crises are not separate.
They share a root cause: our tax system fails to capture the economic
income of the wealthiest Americans while capping contributions from
everyone else.

THE SOLUTION

The Social Security Extension Act has three components:

1. FICA REFORM: Remove the payroll tax cap and extend contributions
   to investment income. This generates $728 billion per year —
   more than enough to guarantee Social Security solvency permanently.

2. TIER 2 BENEFIT: A new monthly payment to every SS beneficiary and
   every working-age adult below the living wage. Revenue-constrained
   (we only pay what we collect), starting at approximately $250/month
   and growing to $1,731/month over 30 years as the system compounds.

3. BILLIONAIRE INCOME TAX: A 40% mark-to-market tax on the unrealized
   gains of the 935 Americans with over $1 billion in wealth. These
   gains currently go completely untaxed through the buy-borrow-die
   strategy documented by ProPublica. This generates $210 billion per
   year, accelerating the build-out of an American Equity Fund —
   a sovereign wealth fund modeled on Norway's $1.7 trillion fund
   and Alaska's Permanent Fund.

THE IMPACT

By Year 30, this system:
  - Provides $1,731/month to 138 million eligible adults
  - Raises retiree income to over $5,000/month (SS + new benefits)
  - Reduces the U.S. income Gini from 0.39 to 0.32 — an 18% reduction
    that brings America from the most unequal developed nation to
    approximately the level of Canada
  - Increases GDP by over 5% through consumer spending by those who
    need it most
  - Requires ZERO deficit spending — fully funded from new revenue

And here is the fact that makes this politically viable: even after
30 years of this tax, the average billionaire's wealth grows from
$8.8 billion to over $100 billion. They are still billionaires. They
still compound. They simply grow six-fold instead of eighteen-fold.

WHY THIS IS SOCIAL SECURITY, NOT UBI

This is not a "universal basic income" proposal. It is Social Security,
extended. The architecture is identical: payroll contributions fund a
defined benefit that cannot be cut. The precedent is 90 years old.
Every expansion of Social Security — survivors (1939), disability
(1956), Medicare (1965), COLA (1972) — was called radical at the time.
Each became the third rail of American politics.

This is the next expansion. And it is overdue.

THE ASK

I respectfully request your consideration of:

  1. Co-sponsoring the Social Security Extension Act when introduced
  2. Requesting CBO scoring of the three-component framework
  3. Calling for hearings in the [Finance/Ways and Means] Committee
     on Social Security solvency options that include benefit expansion

A full policy brief, white paper, and economic working paper are
available upon request.

I believe this proposal represents the single most consequential
economic reform available to this Congress. I welcome the opportunity
to brief you or your staff at your convenience.

Respectfully,
