SOCIAL SECURITY FOR ALL: A NEW PROPOSAL

A new economic plan would extend Social Security-style monthly payments
to every American adult who needs them — funded without adding to the
national debt.

KEY POINTS:

* Social Security's trust fund runs out in 2034. Without action,
  benefits will be cut 23% for 67 million retirees.

* This plan SAVES Social Security first, then extends a second tier
  of monthly benefits to 138 million adults earning below a living wage.

* Funding comes from two sources: closing payroll tax loopholes on
  high earners and a 40% tax on billionaire investment gains that
  currently go untaxed.

* Starting benefits: approximately $250/month per eligible person,
  growing to over $1,700/month within 30 years as the system's
  investment fund compounds.

* Retirees would receive their current Social Security PLUS the new
  benefit — reaching over $5,000/month within 30 years.

* The 935 U.S. billionaires would still see their wealth grow — from
  an average of $8.8 billion to over $100 billion — just more slowly.

* The plan would reduce U.S. income inequality by 18%, bringing America
  in line with Canada and other developed nations.

BOTTOM LINE: Protect Social Security. Give working Americans a floor.
Tax gains that currently escape taxation. No one gets poorer — millions
get a chance.

THREAD: Social Security For All

1/ Social Security runs out of money in 2034. 67 million retirees
   face a 23% benefit cut. We have a plan to fix it AND extend it.

2/ Step 1: Close payroll tax loopholes. Right now, someone making
   $10M/year pays the same SS tax as someone making $168K. That's
   broken.

3/ Step 2: Tax billionaire investment gains that currently go untaxed.
   935 people hold $8.2 TRILLION and pay a lower tax rate than nurses.

4/ Step 3: Build an American Equity Fund — like Norway's $1.7 trillion
   fund, or Alaska's Permanent Fund that sends every Alaskan a check.

5/ Result: $250/month for 138M Americans who need it, growing to
   $1,700/month over 30 years. Retirees get EVEN MORE.

6/ Do billionaires go broke? No. Average billionaire wealth still
   grows from $8.8B to $100B+. They just grow 6x instead of 18x.

7/ This isn't radical. It's what Social Security was always meant
   to be: insurance that no American falls below a basic standard.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

SOCIAL SECURITY EXTENSION ACT: PROTECTING RETIREES, EXTENDING
THE SAFETY NET TO WORKING AMERICANS

[City, Date] — A new proposal to save Social Security from insolvency
and extend monthly benefits to 138 million working-age Americans was
released today, backed by economic modeling showing full fiscal
sustainability without new deficit spending.

The Social Security Extension would:
  - Prevent the projected 23% benefit cut facing 67 million retirees
    when the trust fund is depleted in 2034
  - Create a "Tier 2" monthly benefit for adults earning below a living
    wage ($2,200/month), starting at approximately $250/month
  - Fund the system through payroll tax reform on high earners and a
    40% mark-to-market tax on billionaire investment gains
  - Establish an American Equity Fund modeled on Norway's $1.7 trillion
    sovereign wealth fund and Alaska's Permanent Fund

Economic modeling projects:
  - Benefits growing to $1,731/month per eligible adult within 30 years
  - U.S. income inequality reduced by 18% (Gini coefficient 0.39 to 0.32)
  - Positive GDP impact of +5.3% at Year 30 through consumer spending
  - Billionaire wealth still growing (average $8.8B to $110B over 30 years)
  - Social Security fully solvent through the entire projection period

The full proposal is available in policy brief, white paper, and
academic working paper formats at [URL].
