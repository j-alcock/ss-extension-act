Dear [Member],

I am writing regarding a proposal to address the impending Social
Security trust fund depletion — projected for 2034 — through a fully
funded, revenue-constrained reform that strengthens and modernizes the
system without adding to the national debt.

I recognize that you approach fiscal matters with appropriate caution.
This proposal was designed with that discipline in mind. Every dollar
of benefit is tied to a dollar of revenue. There are no unfunded
promises.

THE PROBLEM

The Social Security trust fund will be exhausted by 2034, per the 2024
Trustees Report. At that point, benefits will be automatically reduced
to approximately 77% of scheduled levels — a 23% cut affecting your
constituents who are among the 67 million Americans receiving Social
Security. No legislation is required for this cut to occur; it is the
default.

Meanwhile, the existing revenue structure has a design flaw: the FICA
earnings cap means that someone earning $10 million per year pays the
same dollar amount in Social Security tax as someone earning $168,600.
Income above the cap — including all investment income — contributes
nothing to the system.

THE PROPOSAL: FISCALLY DISCIPLINED REFORM

This is a three-part reform designed for solvency first:

1. FIX SOCIAL SECURITY (Component 1: FICA Reform)

   Remove the FICA earnings cap and extend payroll contributions at
   half-rate to investment income. This generates approximately $728
   billion per year in new revenue — far exceeding the current $200
   billion annual deficit.

   This mirrors the structure already used by Medicare's Hospital
   Insurance tax, which has had no earnings cap since 1994. It is not
   a new concept. It is applying an existing precedent.

   KEY POINT: This single reform solves Social Security solvency
   permanently, without any other provision. Everything else in this
   proposal is funded from the surplus.

2. USE THE SURPLUS PRODUCTIVELY (Component 2: Tier 2 Benefit)

   After covering the SS deficit, surplus revenue funds a "Tier 2"
   monthly supplement for Social Security beneficiaries and working-age
   adults below the living wage ($2,200/month).

   This is REVENUE-CONSTRAINED by design:

     Benefit = (Revenue - Deficit - Fund Contribution) /
               (Eligible Population x 12)

   If revenue falls, benefits fall. If revenue rises, benefits rise.
   There is NO unfunded promise. This is the opposite of Social
   Security's current structure, which makes benefit promises that
   outstrip revenue.

   Year 0 benefit: approximately $250/month per eligible person
   Year 30 benefit: approximately $1,731/month (as revenue compounds)

   Eligible population: 138 million (SS beneficiaries + working-age
   adults below living wage). Benefits do NOT count as income for
   eligibility purposes — this avoids the poverty trap that has
   undermined means-tested programs.

3. BUILD A SOVEREIGN EQUITY FUND (Component 3: American Equity Fund)

   A portion of surplus revenue funds a sovereign equity fund modeled
   on two bipartisan success stories:

   - The Alaska Permanent Fund ($80B, paying dividends to every
     Alaskan for 40+ years, supported by both parties)
   - Norway's Government Pension Fund ($1.7 trillion, independent
     governance, transparent reporting)

   The fund invests in a diversified global portfolio, governed by an
   independent board with Senate-confirmed members and staggered terms.
   Congress has no draw rights. Investment policy is set by statute.

THE BILLIONAIRE COMPONENT: OPTIONAL ACCELERANT

A 40% mark-to-market tax on billionaire economic income generates
$210 billion per year and accelerates the fund build-out. However —
and this is important — the system works without it. FICA reform alone
funds the entire system, including Tier 2 benefits and the equity fund.
The billionaire tax makes it faster, not possible.

If constitutional concerns make the M2M tax unviable (Moore v. United
States, 2024, left this question open), alternative structures are
available: a minimum tax with lookback, mandatory realization at death,
or enhanced exit taxation.

FISCAL ACCOUNTABILITY

  - CBO-scorable: every revenue source has a statutory base and rate
  - No deficit spending: benefits mechanically tied to collections
  - Annual reporting: AEF reports to Congress, audited by GAO
  - Automatic adjustment: if revenue falls, benefits adjust downward
  - Reserve fund: 10% of Tier 2 outlays held in reserve for smoothing

THE ASK

This is a proposal that can be scored by CBO, reviewed by JCT, and
debated on its merits. I respectfully request:

  1. A staff-level briefing on the fiscal mechanics (30 minutes)
  2. Consideration for the Problem Solvers Caucus / bipartisan working
     group agenda on Social Security reform
  3. Support for committee hearings on revenue-constrained SS reform

I have attached a 2-page executive brief and an 8-page policy brief
with full projections and citations. A comprehensive white paper and
academic working paper are available upon request.

The 2034 deadline is not a partisan issue. It is an actuarial fact.
This proposal offers a path that saves the system, extends its
protection, and does so without a single dollar of deficit spending.

Respectfully,
