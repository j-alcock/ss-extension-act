RE: Strengthening Social Security Solvency — Bipartisan Framework

Dear Senator Mark Kelly,

I am writing regarding the Social Security solvency crisis. The trust fund is projected to be depleted by 2034, at which point 67 million beneficiaries face an automatic 23% benefit cut. I wish to bring a fiscally responsible solution to your attention.

THE PROPOSAL: A revenue-constrained Social Security modernization that:

1. RESTRUCTURES FICA contributions to fund extended benefits — no new deficit spending
2. Uses a mathematical revenue constraint: benefits = available_revenue / eligible_population — solvency is guaranteed by construction
3. OPTIONALLY supplements with a mark-to-market tax on billionaire economic income ($210B/year from 935 individuals holding $8.2 trillion)
4. Creates a sovereign equity fund (Alaska Permanent Fund / Norway model) for stable returns

FISCAL DISCIPLINE FEATURES:
- Zero deficit impact — revenue-constrained formula prevents overspending
- Benefits ratchet down automatically if revenue declines (Dybvig 1995 mechanism)
- Reserve fund covers temporary shortfalls without borrowing
- Independent actuarial review built into governance structure
- 40-year projection shows sustainable growth under 5 behavioral scenarios

The base model (FICA restructuring alone) delivers $106/month in Year 1 growing to $442/month by Year 30 for eligible adults below the living wage threshold. With the optional billionaire income tax, benefits reach $249/month in Year 1 and $1,731/month by Year 30.

This has been modeled with stress tests including 50% capital flight scenarios. Even under the most pessimistic assumptions, the program remains solvent because spending cannot exceed revenue.

I would welcome the opportunity to provide a 20-minute staff briefing with fiscal impact documentation.

Respectfully,
